# STAGE 5: META-DOCUMENTATION -- BATCH 1

## The Institution Examines Itself

**Document ID:** STAGE5-META-BATCH1
**Version:** 1.0.0
**Date:** 2026-02-16
**Status:** Ratified
**Classification:** Stage 5 -- Meta-Documentation. Self-analysis documents in which the institution examines and documents its own structure, voice, processes, and philosophy.

## How to Read This Document

This document contains five articles in the META domain. They are self-referential by nature -- the documentation system documenting how it documents, the institution's voice describing that voice, the lifecycle of documents described by a document that itself has a lifecycle. This recursion is not a defect. It is the point.

These articles are not operational manuals. They are mirrors. They exist so that the institution can see itself clearly, identify where it is healthy and where it is decaying, and course-correct before small problems become structural failures. They are written for two readers: the current operator who needs to maintain the documentation system with discipline and self-awareness, and the future operator who needs to understand not just what the system is, but what it thinks of itself.

If the institution's technical articles are its skeleton and muscles, these meta-documentation articles are its nervous system -- the capacity for self-perception, self-evaluation, and self-correction. An institution that cannot examine itself is an institution that cannot learn.

# META-001 -- Documentation System Self-Assessment

**Document ID:** META-001
**Domain:** META -- Meta-Documentation & Standards
**Version:** 1.0.0
**Date:** 2026-02-16
**Status:** Ratified
**Depends On:** META-00-ART-001 (Stage 1 Meta-Framework), ETH-001, CON-001, GOV-001, OPS-001
**Depended Upon By:** All domain-level index articles, META-004 (Cross-Domain Consistency Enforcement)

## 1. Purpose

This article defines how the documentation system evaluates its own health. A documentation institution that does not assess itself is like a hospital that never takes its own blood pressure -- it can serve others while quietly deteriorating from within. The purpose of self-assessment is not to produce a passing grade. It is to produce an honest diagnosis. The institution must know where its documentation is strong, where it is thin, where it is missing entirely, and where it is aging past the point of reliability.

Self-assessment is the mechanism by which the institution detects documentation debt before that debt becomes documentation bankruptcy. It is the process by which coverage gaps are identified before they become knowledge gaps. And it is the discipline by which quality is maintained not through inspiration but through measurement.

This article is addressed to the operator who must conduct these assessments. It tells you what to measure, how to measure it, how often to measure it, and what to do when the measurements reveal problems.

## 2. Scope

**In scope:**

- Metrics for documentation health: what they are, how they are calculated, why they matter.
- The annual documentation census: what it covers, how it is conducted, what it produces.
- Coverage analysis across all 20 domains: how to determine whether a domain is adequately documented.
- Gap detection: how to identify what is missing, not just what is wrong.
- Quality trends over time: how to track whether documentation is improving, stable, or degrading.
- The self-assessment report format.
- Triggers for emergency documentation interventions.

**Out of scope:**

- The specific content standards for articles (see META-00-ART-001, Stage 1 Meta-Framework).
- Cross-domain consistency checking (see META-004).
- The writing style and voice of documentation (see META-002).
- The lifecycle of individual documents (see META-003).

## 3. Background

Documentation systems fail silently. Unlike hardware, which alerts you when a disk is dying, and unlike software, which crashes when a configuration is wrong, documentation simply becomes stale. An article that was accurate two years ago may be dangerously misleading today, and nothing in the system will warn you. A domain that should have thirty articles may have twelve, and the absence of the missing eighteen is invisible unless you look for it.

This silence is the fundamental challenge of documentation maintenance. The institution defined in CON-001 declares that documentation *is* the institution -- that the hardware can be replaced but the documentation cannot. If that claim is sincere, then the health of the documentation is the health of the institution. And health requires regular checkups.

The concept of a documentation census is borrowed from the tradition of institutional audit. Libraries conduct collection assessments. Archives conduct preservation surveys. Standards bodies conduct compliance audits. This institution conducts documentation self-assessments for the same reason: because the collection cannot maintain itself, and because the act of assessment is itself a form of maintenance. You cannot evaluate an article without reading it. You cannot read it without noticing what has changed in reality since it was written. The assessment is not separate from the maintenance. It is the beginning of maintenance.

The challenge for a single-operator institution is that the assessor and the assessed are the same person. There is no external auditor to bring fresh eyes. This makes the assessment process more important, not less. The structure of the assessment must compensate for the operator's inevitable blind spots, biases, and emotional attachments to their own work.

## 4. System Model

### 4.1 The Documentation Health Model

Documentation health is assessed across five dimensions. Each dimension captures a different aspect of whether the documentation is serving its purpose:

**Dimension 1: Coverage.** Does documentation exist for everything that needs to be documented? Coverage is the ratio of documented systems, processes, and decisions to total systems, processes, and decisions. A coverage gap means something exists in reality but not in the documentation. Coverage is the most fundamental dimension -- you cannot assess the quality of documentation that does not exist.

**Dimension 2: Currency.** Is the documentation current? Currency measures whether articles reflect the present state of the systems they describe. An article that was accurate when written but no longer reflects reality has a currency problem. Currency degrades with time and with change. Every modification to a system that is not reflected in its documentation is a currency debt.

**Dimension 3: Accuracy.** Is the documentation correct? Accuracy measures whether the claims, procedures, and specifications in the documentation match verifiable reality. An article can be current (recently updated) but inaccurate (the update introduced errors). Accuracy requires verification, not just review.

**Dimension 4: Completeness.** Does each article contain all the information a reader needs? Completeness is different from coverage. Coverage asks whether an article exists. Completeness asks whether the article that exists is thorough. An article about a backup procedure that omits the recovery steps has a completeness problem.

**Dimension 5: Usability.** Can a competent reader find, understand, and act on the documentation? Usability encompasses findability (can you locate the article?), readability (can you understand it?), and actionability (can you do what it says?). A technically perfect article that no one can find is useless.

### 4.2 The Annual Documentation Census

The documentation census is a structured, comprehensive review of the entire documentation corpus. It is conducted once per year as part of the annual operations cycle defined in OPS-001. The census is not a casual reading. It is a systematic evaluation with defined procedures and recorded results.

The census proceeds in three phases:

**Phase 1: Inventory (1 day).** Count every article in every domain. Record each article's ID, title, current version, last modification date, and status. Compare the inventory against the expected article list maintained in each domain's index. Identify articles that exist but are not indexed, articles that are indexed but do not exist, and articles whose status is inconsistent with their content.

**Phase 2: Evaluation (2-3 days).** For each article, assess the five health dimensions. This does not require reading every article in full every year. Use a sampling strategy: read every root document (ETH-001, CON-001, GOV-001, SEC-001, OPS-001) in full. Read every article that was modified in the past year in full. For articles not modified in the past year, read the Purpose, Scope, and Rules sections and spot-check one procedure or specification against reality.

**Phase 3: Reporting (1 day).** Compile the results into a self-assessment report. The report format is defined in Section 4.4. Record the report in the institutional log. Identify the three highest-priority gaps or quality issues. Create action items with deadlines for addressing them.

### 4.3 Gap Detection Methods

Gaps are absences -- things that should be documented but are not. Gaps are harder to detect than errors because you are looking for something that is not there. The following methods are used to detect gaps:

**Reality walk.** Physically walk through the institution's infrastructure. For every piece of hardware, every cable, every system you see, ask: "Is this documented?" If not, record the gap.

**Procedure trace.** Pick a complex operational scenario (e.g., "recover from a total power failure" or "onboard a new operator"). Trace through the documentation required to execute the scenario. Every point where the documentation is missing, incomplete, or unclear is a gap.

**Domain completeness check.** For each domain, review the domain index and ask: "What topics should this domain cover that it does not?" Use the domain description from META-00-ART-001 as a guide. Compare what exists against what a knowledgeable reader would expect to find.

**Dependency audit.** Review the dependency graph (META-00-ART-001, Section 8). For every dependency relationship, verify that the referenced article exists and is in Published status. A dependency on a non-existent article is a structural gap.

**Newcomer test.** Imagine you are reading the documentation for the first time, following the reading order defined in META-00-ART-001, Section 8.3. At what points would you be confused? At what points would you lack the information you need to proceed? Those are gaps.

### 4.4 The Self-Assessment Report Format

Each annual self-assessment produces a report with the following structure:

- **Report date and assessment period.**
- **Inventory summary:** Total articles by domain, by status, by age (time since last modification).
- **Coverage assessment:** Domains with adequate coverage, domains with gaps, and a list of specific gaps identified.
- **Currency assessment:** Articles that are current, articles that are stale (not modified in over two years and describing systems that have changed), articles that are critically stale (not modified in over five years).
- **Accuracy spot-check results:** Articles verified against reality, discrepancies found.
- **Completeness assessment:** Articles missing required sections, articles with placeholder content.
- **Usability assessment:** Articles that are difficult to find, difficult to understand, or difficult to act on.
- **Trend analysis:** Comparison with previous year's assessment. Is coverage improving, stable, or declining? Is quality improving, stable, or declining?
- **Priority action items:** The three to five most important issues to address, with deadlines and responsible party (which, in a single-operator institution, is always the operator).
- **Commentary:** The operator's overall impression of the documentation's health, including concerns that do not fit neatly into the metrics.

## 5. Rules & Constraints

1. **R-META-001-01:** The annual documentation census must be completed during the annual operations cycle defined in OPS-001. It may not be skipped or deferred without a Tier 3 governance decision recorded in the decision log.

2. **R-META-001-02:** The self-assessment report must be stored as an article in the META domain with a sequential identifier. Reports are never revised or deleted. They are historical records.

3. **R-META-001-03:** Every domain must be included in the census. No domain may be excluded on the grounds that "nothing changed." The absence of change may itself be a finding.

4. **R-META-001-04:** Gaps identified during the census must be recorded in the self-assessment report regardless of whether the operator intends to address them immediately. Acknowledging a gap is a prerequisite to closing it.

5. **R-META-001-05:** Any article not modified in more than five years must be flagged for review during the census. The flag does not require immediate action, but it requires a recorded judgment: "still accurate," "needs update," or "should be archived."

6. **R-META-001-06:** The self-assessment must include a comparison with the previous year's report. If no previous report exists (first year), this requirement is waived.

7. **R-META-001-07:** Quality metrics must be qualitative, not quantitative. The institution does not assign numerical scores to articles. It makes human judgments about health, recorded in prose. Numbers without judgment are meaningless; judgment without numbers is acceptable.

8. **R-META-001-08:** The census must assess not only individual articles but also the relationships between articles -- broken cross-references, orphaned articles (referenced by nothing and referencing nothing), and dependency chains that no longer reflect reality.

## 6. Failure Modes

- **Census skipping.** The operator skips the annual census because it feels time-consuming and the documentation "seems fine." Over several years, coverage gaps accumulate, currency degrades, and the operator loses awareness of the documentation's actual state. Mitigation: the census is embedded in the annual operations cycle, which is mandatory per OPS-001. Skipping requires a governance decision, which forces conscious acknowledgment.

- **Assessment dishonesty.** The operator conducts the census but rates everything favorably because acknowledging problems feels like acknowledging personal failure. The assessment becomes a formality that produces comforting falsehoods. Mitigation: ETH-001, Principle 6 (Honest Accounting of Limitations) applies to self-assessment. The assessment is a diagnostic tool, not a performance review. The institution has no pride to protect.

- **Gap paralysis.** The census reveals so many gaps that the operator becomes overwhelmed and addresses none of them. The assessment becomes a source of anxiety rather than a tool for improvement. Mitigation: the report requires only three to five priority action items. The operator is not expected to close every gap in one year. The expectation is sustained progress, not perfection.

- **Metric fixation.** The operator becomes obsessed with improving metrics rather than improving documentation. Articles are created to fill coverage gaps but contain minimal useful content. The metrics look good while the documentation remains inadequate. Mitigation: R-META-001-07 requires qualitative, not quantitative, assessment. The question is "is this documentation useful?" not "is this cell in the spreadsheet filled?"

- **Stale assessment methodology.** The assessment process itself becomes outdated. The dimensions it measures no longer capture the aspects of documentation health that matter. Mitigation: the Evolution Path section below defines how the assessment methodology should evolve.

## 7. Recovery Procedures

1. **If the census has been skipped for one or more years:** Conduct a census immediately, regardless of where you are in the operations cycle. Accept that the first census after a gap will be more painful than a routine census. Focus on the inventory phase first -- just find out what exists. Evaluation and reporting can follow over the next month.

2. **If the assessment has been dishonest:** Conduct a fresh assessment with a commitment to honesty. Read ETH-001 before beginning. When in doubt about whether something is a problem, record it as a problem. A false positive is far less dangerous than a false negative in self-assessment.

3. **If gap paralysis has set in:** Reduce the priority action items to one. Just one. The single most important gap. Close it. Then assess what comes next. Momentum is built through small completions, not large ambitions.

4. **If documentation debt has become structural:** Declare a documentation sprint as defined in CON-001, Recovery Procedure 2. Halt non-critical operations. Address the most critical gaps first: recovery procedures, then security procedures, then operational procedures, then everything else.

## 8. Evolution Path

- **Years 0-5:** The assessment process is being established. The first few censuses will be learning experiences. Expect to revise the assessment methodology after the first and second censuses as you discover what the metrics actually reveal and what they miss. The baseline is being established; every year's data gains value as a point of comparison.

- **Years 5-15:** The assessment should be routine. Trends should be visible across multiple years. The methodology should be stable. Focus shifts from establishing the process to using the process as a genuine management tool. The operator should be able to predict which domains will have problems before the census confirms it.

- **Years 15-30:** A successor may be involved in the assessment. The assessment process becomes a training tool -- conducting a census is one of the best ways to learn the documentation corpus. The assessment methodology may need revision to accommodate a multi-generational institution with decades of accumulated articles.

- **Years 30-50+:** The census is now evaluating documentation that spans multiple generations of hardware, software, and possibly operators. Historical trend data stretching back decades becomes a primary asset. The assessment must now also evaluate whether the oldest articles in the corpus still serve any purpose or whether they should be archived.

## 9. Commentary Section

**2026-02-16 -- Founding Entry:**
The temptation in designing a self-assessment system is to make it rigorous to the point of being burdensome. I have tried to resist this. The census takes three to five days per year. That is not trivial, but it is manageable. The alternative -- not knowing what state your documentation is in -- is far more expensive in the long run. The first census will be the hardest, because there is no baseline for comparison and because the act of systematic evaluation will reveal problems that were easy to ignore when you were not looking. That discomfort is the assessment working. Lean into it.

I have deliberately avoided numerical scoring. I do not want to see articles rated "7 out of 10" for quality. That number would provide the illusion of precision while concealing the subjective judgment underneath. A prose statement -- "this article is mostly accurate but the recovery procedure in Section 7.1 has not been tested in two years and I am not confident it still works" -- is more honest, more useful, and harder to game. The institution values integrity over convenience, and honest prose is more integral than comfortable numbers.

# META-002 -- Writing the Institution: A Style and Voice Guide

**Document ID:** META-002
**Domain:** META -- Meta-Documentation & Standards
**Version:** 1.0.0
**Date:** 2026-02-16
**Status:** Ratified
**Depends On:** META-00-ART-001 (Stage 1 Meta-Framework), ETH-001, CON-001
**Depended Upon By:** All articles in all domains. Every document in the institution is subject to this guide.

---

## 1. Purpose

This article defines the voice, tone, and style in which the institution's documentation is written. It is the meta-guide -- the document about how documents should read. Its purpose is not to impose arbitrary stylistic preferences but to ensure that hundreds of articles written across decades and potentially by different authors sound like they belong to the same institution.

Voice consistency matters because the documentation is the institution. When a reader moves from an article about power systems to an article about security procedures to an article about food production, they should feel that they are navigating a single coherent body of knowledge, not a collection of unrelated pamphlets. The voice is what unifies the corpus. It is the thread that ties the domains together at a level deeper than cross-references and dependency graphs.

This article is also a defense against two opposing dangers: the danger of institutional voice becoming sterile and bureaucratic over time, and the danger of institutional voice becoming inconsistent and fragmented as different authors contribute. Both dangers are real. Both are addressed here.

## 2. Scope

**In scope:**

- The institutional voice: what it sounds like, what principles govern it, and what it refuses to sound like.
- Tone calibration: how tone shifts across different types of content while remaining recognizably institutional.
- Consistency maintenance across hundreds of articles and across decades.
- Voice drift detection: how to notice when the voice is changing and how to decide whether that change is evolution or erosion.
- Practical writing guidance: sentence structure, paragraph length, word choice, and the handling of uncertainty.
- The relationship between the institutional voice and commentary voice.

**Out of scope:**

- Formatting standards (covered in META-00-ART-001, Section 3.4).
- The article template structure (covered in META-00-ART-001, Section 3.1).
- Terminology and glossary maintenance (covered in META-004 and the LRNG domain).
- The technical review and publishing process (covered in META-003).

## 3. Background

Every institution that endures develops a voice. The voice of the United States Constitution is formal, declarative, and deliberately impersonal. The voice of a Quaker meeting's minutes is plain, careful, and consensus-oriented. The voice of a ship's log is terse, factual, and time-stamped. These voices were not accidents. They were choices -- conscious or unconscious -- about how an institution presents itself to its own members and to posterity.

The holm.chat Documentation Institution needs a voice that serves a specific set of requirements. The documentation must be readable by a technically competent person who is not an expert in the specific domain. It must be clear enough to act on during emergencies. It must be honest enough to admit uncertainty. It must be durable enough to remain useful decades after it was written. And it must be human enough that reading it does not feel like reading a legal brief or a corporate policy manual.

These requirements produce a voice that is authoritative but not pompous, precise but not pedantic, honest but not self-indulgent, and warm but not casual. Finding this balance is the central challenge of institutional writing. Maintaining it over decades is harder still.

The founding of this institution presents a particular challenge: the entire initial corpus is written by a single person. This gives the early documentation an unusual consistency of voice -- one mind, one style. But it also means that the voice is, inevitably, the founder's voice. When successors begin contributing, they must learn to write in the institutional voice, not their own. This article provides the guidance they will need, and that the founder needs now to make explicit what is currently implicit.

## 4. System Model

### 4.1 The Three Registers of Institutional Voice

The institutional voice operates in three registers, each appropriate to different types of content:

**Register 1: Directive.** Used for procedures, rules, and operational instructions. This register is imperative, sequential, and action-oriented. It tells the reader what to do. Sentences are short. Ambiguity is eliminated. The tone is confident and direct without being aggressive.

Example: "Verify the backup completed successfully. Check the log file for errors. If errors are present, do not proceed to the next step. Record the error in the operational log and consult the recovery procedures in Section 7."

**Register 2: Expository.** Used for background sections, system descriptions, and explanations. This register is explanatory, structured, and didactic. It tells the reader how something works or why a decision was made. Sentences may be longer and more complex. The tone is patient and thorough.

Example: "The decision to use ZFS as the primary filesystem was driven by three requirements: data integrity verification through checksums, native support for snapshots that enable efficient point-in-time recovery, and a long track record of reliability in production environments. Other filesystems were evaluated, including Btrfs and XFS. Btrfs was rejected due to concerns about stability in RAID configurations as of the evaluation date (2026-01). XFS was rejected because it lacks native checksumming."

**Register 3: Reflective.** Used primarily in Commentary sections and in philosophical or strategic articles like those in Domain 1 (Constitution & Philosophy). This register is personal, contemplative, and honest. It tells the reader what the author thinks and feels. The first person is permitted. Doubt is permitted. The tone is human and candid.

Example: "I chose this approach because it felt right, but I want to be honest: the evidence was inconclusive. The academic literature was divided. My own experience was limited to three years of running a similar but smaller system. A future operator with more data may reasonably choose differently, and I would not consider that a repudiation of this decision -- I would consider it the system working as intended."

### 4.2 Voice Principles

The institutional voice is governed by seven principles:

**Principle V1: Clarity is non-negotiable.** If a reader must re-read a sentence to understand it, the sentence has failed. Rewrite until the meaning is unambiguous on first reading. This does not mean every sentence must be short -- it means every sentence must be clear.

**Principle V2: Honesty includes uncertainty.** Do not write with false confidence. If a procedure has not been tested, say so. If a recommendation is based on limited evidence, say so. The reader needs to know how much weight to give your words. False certainty is a form of dishonesty.

**Principle V3: Respect the reader.** The reader is intelligent. Do not condescend. Do not over-explain things that any technically competent person would know. But also do not assume specialized knowledge. The target reader is someone who is smart, motivated, and unfamiliar with this specific system. Write for that person.

**Principle V4: Context before content.** Always tell the reader why before telling them what. A rule without a reason is a rule that will be broken. A procedure without context is a procedure that will be followed mechanically. The "why" is what enables intelligent adaptation when circumstances change.

**Principle V5: Prefer concrete over abstract.** "The backup runs daily at 02:00 and takes approximately 45 minutes" is better than "the backup runs regularly." Specifics are verifiable. Abstractions are not.

**Principle V6: Acknowledge the human.** The institution is built and operated by human beings. Documentation that pretends otherwise is documentation that does not account for fatigue, error, motivation, or the passage of time. Write for humans, not for machines.

**Principle V7: Durability over fashion.** Write in language that will be comprehensible in thirty years. Avoid slang, trendy jargon, cultural references that may not travel through time, and sentence structures that depend on contemporary idiom. Plain, direct English ages better than clever English.

### 4.3 Voice Drift Detection

Voice drift occurs when the institutional voice gradually changes without conscious decision. Like all forms of institutional drift, it is gradual, usually invisible to the person drifting, and potentially corrosive if unaddressed. Voice drift is not the same as voice evolution. Evolution is deliberate and documented. Drift is unconscious and unexamined.

Signs of voice drift:

- New articles sound noticeably different from older articles in ways that are not explained by the different subject matter.
- Terminology begins to shift: the same concept is called different things in different articles without explanation.
- The level of formality changes: articles become more bureaucratic or more casual without a conscious style decision.
- The tone toward the reader changes: articles become more condescending or more presumptuous about the reader's knowledge.
- Commentary entries adopt a markedly different voice from the article body without the shift being a deliberate register change.
- Sentences become longer and more convoluted over time as the author becomes more comfortable with the subject matter and less disciplined about clarity.

Voice drift is assessed during the annual documentation census (META-001). The assessment involves reading articles from different time periods side by side and asking: "Do these sound like they were written for the same institution?" If the answer is no, the drift must be evaluated: is this an improvement (and therefore should be adopted consciously), a deterioration (and therefore should be corrected), or a neutral change (and therefore should be accepted and documented)?

## 5. Rules & Constraints

1. **R-META-002-01:** All articles must be written in the appropriate register (Directive, Expository, or Reflective) for their content type. Mixing registers within a section is permitted when the content requires it, but the transitions must be smooth.

2. **R-META-002-02:** Jargon must be defined at point of first use within each article. Do not assume the reader has read other articles, even if the dependency chain implies they should have. Each article must be self-sufficient in its terminology.

3. **R-META-002-03:** The first person singular ("I") is reserved for Commentary sections and for the Letters to the Future Maintainer. All other sections use impersonal constructions ("the operator," "the system," "the institution") or the imperative mood ("verify the backup" rather than "you should verify the backup").

4. **R-META-002-04:** Hedging language ("might," "perhaps," "it is possible that") is permitted only when genuine uncertainty exists. When the institution has made a decision, state the decision directly. When the institution is uncertain, state the uncertainty directly. Do not hedge for politeness.

5. **R-META-002-05:** Sentences should average 15-25 words. No single sentence should exceed 50 words. If a sentence exceeds 50 words, split it. Complexity of thought does not require complexity of syntax.

6. **R-META-002-06:** Paragraphs should contain 3-6 sentences. A single-sentence paragraph is acceptable for emphasis but should be rare. A paragraph exceeding 8 sentences should be split.

7. **R-META-002-07:** Active voice is preferred over passive voice. "The operator runs the backup" is preferred over "the backup is run by the operator." Passive voice is acceptable when the actor is unknown or irrelevant.

8. **R-META-002-08:** Voice drift assessment must be included in the annual documentation census. At minimum, three articles from different time periods must be compared for voice consistency.

9. **R-META-002-09:** When a successor or new author contributes to the institution's documentation, they must read this article and produce a sample article for style review before their contributions are published. The style review compares their sample against the existing corpus for voice consistency.

10. **R-META-002-10:** This style guide itself is subject to evolution through the governance process defined in GOV-001. Changes to the institutional voice are Tier 3 decisions at minimum, requiring a 7-day waiting period and documentation in the decision log.

## 6. Failure Modes

- **Bureaucratic creep.** The institutional voice becomes increasingly formal, stiff, and impersonal over time. Articles begin to read like government regulations rather than practical guides. The human element disappears. Readers disengage. Mitigation: the Reflective register and the Commentary system exist specifically to counterbalance formality. Regular voice drift assessment checks for excessive formality.

- **Casual erosion.** The opposite failure: the voice becomes too informal, losing the precision and authority that institutional documentation requires. Articles begin to read like blog posts. Procedures become vague. The distinction between opinion and instruction blurs. Mitigation: the voice principles, particularly V1 (clarity) and V7 (durability), anchor the voice against excessive casualness.

- **Successor voice collision.** A new author writes in a significantly different voice, creating a jarring inconsistency in the corpus. Mitigation: R-META-002-09 requires a style review for new authors. This is not about suppressing individual voice but about ensuring institutional coherence.

- **Fossilized voice.** The style guide is followed so rigidly that the voice cannot evolve to accommodate new types of content or new contexts. The guide becomes a constraint on clear communication rather than a support for it. Mitigation: the Evolution Path below defines how the voice should adapt over time, and R-META-002-10 provides a mechanism for deliberate change.

- **Clarity-precision tradeoff failure.** The pursuit of precision leads to prose that is technically unambiguous but practically unreadable. The pursuit of clarity leads to prose that is readable but imprecise. Finding the balance is a skill, not a formula, and it can degrade. Mitigation: the read-aloud test from META-00-ART-001, Quality Gate G4, catches readability problems. The accuracy checks from the review workflow catch precision problems.

## 7. Recovery Procedures

1. **If bureaucratic creep is detected:** Select three articles that exemplify the problem. Rewrite their most affected sections. Compare the before and after. Use the rewritten versions as calibration examples for future writing. Add a commentary entry to this article noting the correction and the lessons learned.

2. **If casual erosion is detected:** Review the voice principles in Section 4.2. Identify which principles are being violated. Select the most affected articles and revise them, paying particular attention to the Directive register sections (procedures and rules) where casualness is most dangerous.

3. **If a successor's voice is inconsistent:** Do not reject the successor's contributions outright. Identify the specific dimensions of inconsistency (formality level, sentence structure, terminology, tone). Provide concrete examples of how the institutional voice handles the same type of content. Revise the contributions collaboratively, preserving the successor's insights while aligning the voice.

4. **If the voice has fossilized:** Convene a deliberate voice review. Read the five founding articles (ETH-001 through OPS-001) to reconnect with the original voice. Then read recent articles to identify where the guide has constrained rather than supported. Propose specific amendments to this guide through the Tier 3 governance process.

## 8. Evolution Path

- **Years 0-5:** The voice is being established. The founder is the only author. Consistency is easy because there is only one voice. The challenge is making the implicit voice explicit -- writing this guide and refining it based on actual writing experience. Expect this article to undergo at least one minor revision as the founder discovers aspects of the voice that were not captured in the initial draft.

- **Years 5-15:** The voice is established. New articles should naturally conform to the established voice because the founder has internalized it. The danger in this period is fossilization or unconscious drift. Annual voice drift assessments become the primary maintenance mechanism.

- **Years 15-30:** Succession is the critical voice challenge. A new author must learn a voice that is not their own. This article becomes a training document. The Commentary sections throughout the corpus become examples of the Reflective register in practice. Expect tension between preserving the founding voice and allowing the successor's own voice to emerge. This tension is healthy if managed consciously.

- **Years 30-50+:** The institutional voice may have evolved significantly from the founding voice. This is acceptable if the evolution was deliberate and documented. What matters is not that the voice remains identical to 2026 but that the voice remains internally consistent and serves the principles of clarity, honesty, and durability that define it.

## 9. Commentary Section

**2026-02-16 -- Founding Entry:**
Writing a style guide for yourself feels strange. I know how I write. Why do I need to document it? The answer is the same answer that applies to everything in this institution: because I will not always be here, and because even while I am here, I will not always remember what I intended. A style guide is not a constraint on the writer. It is a gift to the reader -- a promise that the documentation will feel coherent no matter when it was written or by whom.

I want to name something that this guide deliberately avoids: a prohibition on personality. The institutional voice is not the absence of personality. It is the discipline of personality. The Commentary sections are where personality lives most freely, but even in the expository and directive registers, the voice should feel like it belongs to a human being who cares about what they are writing. Documentation written by a person who does not care reads like documentation written by a person who does not care. Readers can tell. I want every reader of this institution's documentation to feel that the author gave a damn. That is the voice I am trying to preserve.

# META-003 -- The Documentation Lifecycle: From Idea to Archive

**Document ID:** META-003
**Domain:** META -- Meta-Documentation & Standards
**Version:** 1.0.0
**Date:** 2026-02-16
**Status:** Ratified
**Depends On:** META-00-ART-001 (Stage 1 Meta-Framework), GOV-001, OPS-001
**Depended Upon By:** All articles in all domains (every article passes through this lifecycle)

---

## 1. Purpose

This article describes the complete lifecycle of a document in the holm.chat Documentation Institution -- from the moment a need for documentation is identified, through drafting, review, publication, active use, revision, and eventual archival or retirement. META-00-ART-001 defines the states an article can be in and the rules for transitioning between them. This article goes deeper. It examines the *life* of a document: how it is born, how it matures, how it is maintained, and how it eventually reaches the end of its useful existence.

Understanding the lifecycle matters because documents are not static artifacts. They are living components of a living institution. A document that was essential five years ago may be obsolete today. A document that seems unnecessary now may become critical in a crisis. The lifecycle framework provides the conceptual tools for making these judgments -- for knowing when to create, when to revise, and when to let go.

## 2. Scope

**In scope:**

- The complete document lifecycle from initial need identification through archival.
- Decision criteria at each stage: when to proceed, when to pause, when to abandon.
- The distinction between scheduled lifecycle events (routine reviews, planned revisions) and unscheduled events (emergency revisions, obsolescence).
- The relationship between individual document lifecycles and the health of the overall documentation corpus.
- The emotional and psychological dimensions of document lifecycle management (why it is hard to archive documents you wrote, and why that difficulty must be overcome).

**Out of scope:**

- The specific formatting and structural requirements for articles (see META-00-ART-001).
- The state transition rules and publishing process in detail (see META-00-ART-001, Sections 4 and 5).
- Cross-domain consistency during the lifecycle (see META-004).
- The commentary system (see META-005).

## 3. Background

Every document begins as a response to a need and ends when that need ceases to exist. Between those two points lies a series of stages, each with its own challenges and decision points. The Stage 1 Meta-Framework defines six formal states (Draft, Review, Approved, Published, Revised, Archived) and the rules for transitioning between them. But the formal states do not capture the full story of a document's life.

A document is not merely a file that moves through states. It is a repository of institutional knowledge that must be kept aligned with reality. Reality changes. Hardware is replaced. Procedures are refined. Threats evolve. The weather patterns that inform solar energy production shift over decades. Every change in reality creates a potential divergence between what the documentation says and what is true. Managing that divergence -- detecting it, evaluating it, correcting it -- is the essence of documentation lifecycle management.

The institutions that are best at this are the ones that treat documentation maintenance not as a chore but as a form of institutional hygiene. Libraries weed their collections. Archives appraise and deaccession. Standards bodies sunset outdated standards. These are not acts of destruction. They are acts of care. A collection that never removes anything becomes a collection where nothing can be found.

This article exists because the holm.chat Documentation Institution will, over decades, produce hundreds of articles. Some will remain relevant for the entire life of the institution. Others will be superseded, rendered obsolete by technological change, or simply outlived by the systems they describe. The lifecycle framework provides the discipline for managing this natural process of creation, growth, and retirement.

## 4. System Model

### 4.1 The Seven Phases of a Document's Life

While META-00-ART-001 defines six formal states, the lived experience of a document passes through seven phases. The formal states and the lifecycle phases overlap but are not identical:

**Phase 1: Need Identification.** Before a document is drafted, its need must be recognized and articulated. Need identification answers four questions: What gap does this document fill? Who will read it? What will they do differently after reading it? Does this need overlap with an existing document?

Need identification is triggered by several events: the annual documentation census reveals a coverage gap (META-001). A new system is being deployed and requires documentation per OPS-001 (R-OPS-02). A procedure has been followed informally and now needs to be formalized. A failure or near-miss reveals that recovery procedures are undocumented. A decision has been made that needs to be recorded for posterity.

Decision criteria: A document should be created only if the answer to "what will the reader do differently?" is concrete and specific. A document whose answer is "they will know more" is a candidate for inclusion in another document's Background section, not a standalone article.

**Phase 2: Drafting.** The document is written. In the formal state model, this corresponds to the Draft (D) state. The drafting phase is iterative: the author writes, reviews, revises, and writes again. The drafting phase ends when the author believes the document is ready for formal review.

Decision criteria: A draft is ready for review when all required sections are present and substantive, when the self-review checklist can be completed, and when the author can honestly say: "If I had to act on this document today, I could."

**Phase 3: Review and Approval.** The document is evaluated against the quality gates defined in META-00-ART-001, Section 5.4. In a single-operator institution, this means the operator reviews their own work -- a difficult but necessary discipline. The review should occur after at least a 24-hour gap from the last drafting session, to allow fresh perspective.

Decision criteria: The document passes review when all eight quality gates are clear. It fails review when any gate is not met. A failed review returns the document to the Drafting phase with specific, recorded feedback about what needs to change.

**Phase 4: Publication and Active Use.** The document is published and enters active service. This is the longest phase for most documents. During active use, the document is read, consulted, followed, and relied upon. The document's accuracy is tested against reality every time someone uses it.

Decision criteria: A document remains in active use as long as it is accurate, current, and serves a documented need. The annual census (META-001) provides the primary checkpoint for evaluating whether these conditions still hold.

**Phase 5: Revision.** The document needs to be updated. Revision may be triggered by many events: the annual census identifies accuracy or currency problems, a commentary entry flags an issue, a system change renders part of the document obsolete, or a reader (including the operator themselves) discovers an error.

There are three scales of revision. A patch revision corrects typos and clarifies wording without changing meaning. A minor revision adds, modifies, or removes content while maintaining the document's overall scope and purpose. A major revision fundamentally restructures the document, changes its scope, or revises its core recommendations.

Decision criteria: The scale of revision determines the governance tier. Patch revisions are Tier 4 operational decisions. Minor revisions are typically Tier 4 but may be Tier 3 if they affect other domains. Major revisions are Tier 3 at minimum and may be Tier 2 if the document is architecturally significant.

**Phase 6: Decline.** The document becomes less relevant over time. It is still technically accurate, but fewer situations call for it. It describes a system that is being phased out, or a procedure that has been superseded by a better one, or a threat that is no longer present. The document has not failed. It has been outlived.

Decision criteria: A document is in decline when it has not been consulted in over two years and the system or process it describes has been substantially changed or replaced. Decline is not a failure mode. It is a natural stage. The appropriate response is to evaluate whether the document should be revised (to cover the new reality) or archived (because the old reality is gone).

**Phase 7: Archival.** The document is retired from active service. It remains accessible as a historical record -- understanding why past decisions were made requires access to the documentation that informed those decisions. But it is clearly marked as archived and no longer relied upon for operational guidance.

Decision criteria: A document should be archived when it describes a system, process, or policy that no longer exists and has no prospect of returning, or when it has been superseded by a new document that covers the same ground more accurately. Archival is a governance decision: Tier 3 at minimum, recorded in the decision log.

### 4.2 The Revision Trigger Matrix

Not all changes to reality require document revision. The following matrix helps determine when a change in the world requires a change in the documentation:

**Immediate revision required:**
- A procedure is wrong. Following it would cause harm to systems, data, or persons.
- A security credential, access procedure, or safety-critical specification has changed.
- A dependency referenced in the document no longer exists.

**Revision required within 30 days:**
- A system configuration has changed and the document describes the old configuration.
- A new failure mode has been discovered that the document does not cover.
- A recovery procedure has been tested and found to be incomplete or incorrect.

**Revision recommended at next scheduled review:**
- The document's language or structure could be clearer but is not incorrect.
- Additional context has been learned that would make the Background section more useful.
- The Evolution Path predictions have proven correct or incorrect and should be updated.

**Commentary entry sufficient (no revision needed):**
- The author has a new perspective on the document's subject that does not change the document's correctness.
- A real-world experience validates or challenges the document's approach without rendering it wrong.
- A note for future revision is needed but the revision itself is not yet warranted.

### 4.3 The Document Retirement Decision

Archiving a document is harder than it sounds. There are three psychological obstacles:

First, the sunk cost fallacy. The document took time and effort to write. Archiving it feels like wasting that effort. It is not. The document served its purpose during its active life. The effort was not wasted; it was spent.

Second, the "what if" fear. What if the archived information is needed someday? This is addressed by the archival process itself: archived documents remain accessible. They are not deleted. They are reclassified.

Third, the identity attachment. The operator may feel that archiving a document they wrote is a judgment on their work. It is not. It is a judgment on the relevance of the content to the current state of the institution. Good documentation can become obsolete. That is not a failure of the documentation. It is a sign that the institution has evolved.

## 5. Rules & Constraints

1. **R-META-003-01:** No document may be created without a documented need identification that answers the four questions in Phase 1. The need identification is recorded in the article's Background section.

2. **R-META-003-02:** No document may be published without passing through the Review phase. There are no shortcuts from Draft to Published.

3. **R-META-003-03:** Every published document must be evaluated during the annual documentation census for currency, accuracy, and continued relevance.

4. **R-META-003-04:** Documents that have not been modified in five years must be explicitly evaluated for archival during the annual census. The evaluation must result in one of three recorded judgments: "still current and relevant," "needs revision," or "should be archived."

5. **R-META-003-05:** Archival does not mean deletion. Archived documents must remain accessible in the institution's documentation store and on the website (with clear archival marking). The institution does not destroy its own memory.

6. **R-META-003-06:** When a document is archived because it has been superseded, the superseding document must reference the archived document, and the archived document's metadata must identify the superseding document. The linkage must be bidirectional.

7. **R-META-003-07:** Safety-critical documents (security procedures, recovery procedures, emergency protocols) require immediate revision when their accuracy is in question. They may not wait for the next scheduled review.

8. **R-META-003-08:** Every revision must include an entry in the article's version history that explains what changed and why. "Updated" is not an acceptable summary. "Updated recovery procedure to reflect new backup location after storage array migration" is acceptable.

9. **R-META-003-09:** The drafting phase should not exceed 90 days for a standard article. If a draft has been in progress for longer, the scope is likely too broad and the article should be split, or the need identification should be re-evaluated.

## 6. Failure Modes

- **Premature birth.** A document is created before its need is clearly established. It exists because someone thought "we should document this" without articulating who would read it or what they would do differently. The result is documentation that consumes maintenance effort but serves no clear purpose. Mitigation: the need identification questions in Phase 1 filter out premature documents.

- **Eternal draft.** A document enters the drafting phase and never emerges. It is perpetually "almost done." The information it contains is locked in a state where it cannot be relied upon. Mitigation: R-META-003-09 sets a 90-day limit on drafting. If a draft cannot be completed in 90 days, the scope is wrong.

- **Zombie documents.** Documents that are technically published but are no longer accurate or relevant. They persist because no one has the time or inclination to evaluate them. They are not alive (actively useful) but they are not dead (archived). They are the walking dead of the documentation corpus, potentially misleading anyone who consults them. Mitigation: the annual census and the five-year evaluation rule in R-META-003-04.

- **Revision avoidance.** The operator knows a document needs revision but defers the work because it is less interesting than other tasks. The document's accuracy degrades further with each deferral. Mitigation: the revision trigger matrix provides clear criteria for when revision is required versus recommended. Required revisions are not deferrable.

- **Archive reluctance.** The operator cannot bring themselves to archive documents, leading to a corpus that grows without bound and becomes increasingly difficult to navigate. Mitigation: the discussion of psychological obstacles in Section 4.3, and the annual census which forces explicit evaluation of every aging document.

## 7. Recovery Procedures

1. **If premature documents have been published:** Evaluate each one against the Phase 1 need identification questions. For documents that cannot answer those questions, archive them with a note: "Archived due to unclear purpose. May be revived if a clear need is identified."

2. **If eternal drafts have accumulated:** List every draft. For each, ask: "Is this still needed? Can it be completed in 30 days? Can it be split into something completable?" Abandon drafts that have no clear path to completion. Archive the notes for potential future use.

3. **If zombie documents exist:** Conduct a targeted review. For each zombie, determine whether it should be revised (the information is still needed but inaccurate) or archived (the information is no longer needed). Do not leave zombies in Published status.

4. **If revision has been chronically avoided:** Declare a focused revision sprint. Select the five most outdated documents. Revise them. The momentum from completing five revisions usually overcomes the inertia that caused the avoidance.

## 8. Evolution Path

- **Years 0-5:** The lifecycle is mostly about creation. Most documents are being drafted and published for the first time. The Decline and Archival phases are largely theoretical. The challenge is establishing good lifecycle habits: thorough need identification, disciplined review, timely publication.

- **Years 5-15:** The lifecycle enters its mature phase. Revision becomes the primary lifecycle activity as existing documents are updated to reflect operational experience. The first archival decisions will be made as some early documents are superseded. The annual census becomes the primary lifecycle management tool.

- **Years 15-30:** Archival becomes a regular activity. Systems described in early documents will have been replaced. Procedures will have evolved substantially. The challenge is maintaining the will to archive -- to accept that some of the founding documentation has served its purpose and should be retired with dignity.

- **Years 30-50+:** The documentation corpus is now a historical artifact as well as an operational tool. Some documents will have been through multiple revision cycles. Others will have been archived for decades. The lifecycle framework must accommodate a corpus with deep history, including documents that have historical value even though they have no operational value.

## 9. Commentary Section

**2026-02-16 -- Founding Entry:**
I have spent more time on the archival section than on any other part of this article, which is ironic given that no article in this institution has yet been archived. But I believe the willingness to archive -- the willingness to let go of documentation that has served its purpose -- is one of the most important institutional virtues. An institution that can only accumulate and never release will eventually choke on its own output. A library that never deaccessioned would fill every building in the city and still not have room for next year's acquisitions. The documentation corpus must breathe: taking in new material through creation, releasing old material through archival, and maintaining its vitality through revision.

I also want to note something about the emotional dimension of lifecycle management. I have already written thousands of words for this institution. Those words represent hours of thought and effort. The idea that some of those words will eventually be archived -- that they will stop being "current" and become "historical" -- is uncomfortable. But that discomfort is exactly why this article exists. It gives permission to archive. It makes retirement a defined, dignified stage of the lifecycle rather than a shameful secret. Documents that have served well deserve a good retirement, not a lingering half-life as zombie documentation.

# META-004 -- Cross-Domain Consistency Enforcement

**Document ID:** META-004
**Domain:** META -- Meta-Documentation & Standards
**Version:** 1.0.0
**Date:** 2026-02-16
**Status:** Ratified
**Depends On:** META-00-ART-001 (Stage 1 Meta-Framework), META-001, GOV-001
**Depended Upon By:** All domain index articles, all articles with cross-domain references

---

## 1. Purpose

This article defines how the institution ensures that its 20 domains remain consistent with one another. A single document can be internally consistent -- its rules do not contradict each other, its terminology is uniform, its procedures are coherent. But an institution with hundreds of documents spread across 20 domains faces a harder problem: consistency across documents, across domains, and across time.

Cross-domain inconsistency is the silent killer of documentation systems. When the POWR domain calls a component a "charge controller" and the INFR domain calls the same component a "battery regulator," a reader who consults both domains is confused. When the SECR domain mandates a procedure that contradicts a procedure in the OPSYS domain, the operator must choose which to follow, undermining the authority of both. When the STOR domain references a backup location that the INFR domain says was decommissioned, the reference becomes a trap.

This article exists to prevent these failures. It defines the tools, procedures, and disciplines by which the institution maintains consistency across its entire corpus. It is, in effect, the quality assurance function of the documentation system -- not for individual documents (that is covered by the review workflow in META-00-ART-001) but for the relationships between documents.

## 2. Scope

**In scope:**

- Terminology alignment: ensuring the same concepts are named the same way across all domains.
- Contradiction detection: identifying cases where two documents make incompatible claims or prescribe incompatible procedures.
- Reference integrity verification: ensuring all cross-references point to documents that exist and are in the correct state.
- The cross-domain consistency audit: a structured process for verifying consistency.
- Tools and procedures for maintaining consistency in a manual, air-gapped environment.
- The role of the institutional glossary in consistency enforcement.

**Out of scope:**

- Internal consistency within a single article (covered by the self-review checklist in META-00-ART-001).
- Voice and style consistency (covered by META-002).
- The documentation lifecycle (covered by META-003).
- The commentary system (covered by META-005).

## 3. Background

The holm.chat Documentation Institution spans 20 domains with an estimated 239-398 articles at maturity. These domains are not independent silos. The dependency matrix in META-00-ART-001, Section 8.2 shows that every domain depends on at least one other domain, and most domains depend on several. This web of dependencies creates a web of potential inconsistencies.

Inconsistency arises from four sources. First, independent authoring: even when a single person writes all the documentation, they may use different terms or make different assumptions when writing about different domains at different times. Second, asynchronous revision: when one document is revised, related documents in other domains may not be updated simultaneously, creating temporary or permanent misalignment. Third, evolving reality: when a physical system changes, some but not all of the documents describing it may be updated. Fourth, accumulated context: over years and decades, the context in which terms are used may shift subtly, so that two documents use the same word to mean slightly different things.

These sources of inconsistency are inherent in any multi-document system. They cannot be eliminated. They can only be detected and corrected through disciplined process. That process is what this article defines.

The challenge is amplified by the institution's air-gapped nature. There are no automated consistency-checking tools that run against a cloud database. There is no version control system that tracks changes across documents and flags conflicts. Consistency enforcement in this institution is a manual discipline, performed by human attention with the aid of structured procedures. This makes the procedures more important, not less.

## 4. System Model

### 4.1 The Three Layers of Consistency

Consistency operates at three layers, each requiring different verification methods:

**Layer 1: Terminological Consistency.** The same concept must be called the same thing everywhere. This is the most fundamental layer. When the institution refers to the physical structure that houses the servers, it must always use the same term. Whether that term is "server room," "data center," or "computing shelter" does not matter, as long as it is the same term in every document.

Terminological consistency is enforced through the institutional glossary, maintained in the LRNG domain. The glossary is the authoritative source for all technical terms used in the institution. When a term appears in the glossary, every document must use that exact term. When a new term is needed, it must be proposed, defined, and added to the glossary before it is used in documentation.

**Layer 2: Factual Consistency.** Documents must not make contradictory factual claims. If INFR says the primary server has 64 GB of RAM and OPSYS says it has 32 GB, one of them is wrong. If both are published, a reader has no way to know which to trust.

Factual consistency is verified through the cross-domain consistency audit (Section 4.3). It is also partially enforced through the dependency graph: when a document cites a factual claim from another document, the reference creates a verifiable link that can be checked.

**Layer 3: Procedural Consistency.** Procedures described in different domains must not conflict. If SECR mandates that all external media must be quarantined for 48 hours before data transfer, and STOR describes a backup import process that transfers data immediately, the procedures are in conflict. Following one requires violating the other.

Procedural consistency is the hardest layer to verify because procedures interact in complex ways. A procedure in one domain may have preconditions that depend on a procedure in another domain having been completed. These dependency chains must be traceable and non-contradictory.

### 4.2 The Institutional Glossary

The institutional glossary is the foundation of terminological consistency. It is maintained as an article (or set of articles) in the LRNG domain and serves as the authoritative reference for all technical terms.

The glossary operates under the following principles:

**One term, one meaning.** Each glossary entry defines exactly one term with exactly one meaning. If a term has multiple meanings in general usage, the glossary specifies which meaning the institution adopts and notes the existence of other meanings to prevent confusion.

**One meaning, one term.** Each concept has exactly one term in the glossary. Synonyms are listed as redirects to the canonical term, not as separate entries with identical definitions.

**Definition at point of use.** The glossary is the authoritative source, but each article must also define terms at point of first use within the article (per META-002, R-META-002-02). The article-level definition must be consistent with the glossary definition. If they diverge, the glossary prevails and the article must be corrected.

**Living document.** The glossary is revised whenever a new term is needed or an existing term's definition requires refinement. Glossary revisions are Tier 4 governance decisions (operational) unless a term change affects the meaning of existing rules or procedures, in which case the change escalates to Tier 3.

### 4.3 The Cross-Domain Consistency Audit

The cross-domain consistency audit is a structured process conducted annually as part of the documentation census (META-001). It verifies consistency across all three layers.

**Audit Phase 1: Reference Integrity Check.**

For every cross-domain reference in the corpus, verify:
- The referenced document exists.
- The referenced document is in Published status (or Archived, with the reference acknowledging the archival).
- The specific claim, procedure, or specification being referenced still appears in the referenced document at the cited location.
- The referenced content has not been revised in a way that invalidates the reference.

This check produces a list of broken references, stale references, and references to archived documents that need updating.

**Audit Phase 2: Terminology Scan.**

For each domain, identify the key technical terms used. Compare them against the institutional glossary. Flag:
- Terms used in documents that are not in the glossary (candidates for addition).
- Terms used inconsistently across domains (same concept, different words).
- Terms whose in-article definitions diverge from the glossary definition.

This check produces a list of terminological inconsistencies requiring resolution.

**Audit Phase 3: Contradiction Detection.**

This is the most labor-intensive phase. It proceeds by examining the interfaces between domains -- the points where two domains describe the same system, process, or specification from different perspectives.

For each pair of domains with a dependency relationship (as defined in META-00-ART-001, Section 8.2), identify the shared topics. For each shared topic, compare the claims, specifications, and procedures in both domains. Flag any contradictions.

Common contradiction patterns:
- Specification disagreements (different numbers for the same measurement).
- Procedural conflicts (different sequences for the same operation).
- Scope overlaps (two documents both claiming authority over the same topic without acknowledging the other).
- Temporal disagreements (one document reflects a current state, another reflects a previous state).

### 4.4 Consistency Maintenance Tools

In an air-gapped, manual documentation system, "tools" means procedures and structures rather than software. The following tools support consistency maintenance:

**The cross-reference register.** A document (or set of documents) that lists every cross-domain reference in the corpus: source article, target article, the nature of the reference (factual claim, procedural dependency, conceptual definition), and the date the reference was last verified. This register is updated whenever a new cross-reference is created and verified during the annual audit.

**The terminology change log.** An append-only record of every change to the institutional glossary: what term was added, modified, or deprecated, when the change was made, and which articles are affected by the change. When a term changes, this log drives the updates to all affected articles.

**The domain interface map.** For each pair of domains with a dependency relationship, a documented list of the specific topics they share. This map guides the contradiction detection phase of the audit and ensures that no interface is overlooked.

**The consistency exception register.** A record of known inconsistencies that have been evaluated and accepted. Not all inconsistencies are errors. Sometimes two domains use different terms for the same concept because the different terms serve different purposes in their respective domains. The exception register documents these cases, explains why the inconsistency is acceptable, and ensures that future auditors do not flag them as problems.

## 5. Rules & Constraints

1. **R-META-004-01:** Every cross-domain reference in a published article must point to an article that exists and is in Published or Archived status. References to Draft articles are not permitted in published documents.

2. **R-META-004-02:** Every technical term used in the institution's documentation must be defined in the institutional glossary maintained in the LRNG domain. New terms must be added to the glossary before or simultaneously with the publication of the article that introduces them.

3. **R-META-004-03:** When a published article is revised in a way that changes a fact, specification, or procedure that is referenced by another article, the author must identify all referencing articles and either update them or create revision tasks for them. No revision may be published in isolation if it creates a known inconsistency.

4. **R-META-004-04:** The cross-domain consistency audit must be conducted annually as part of the documentation census. The audit results must be recorded and stored as part of the self-assessment report (META-001).

5. **R-META-004-05:** Contradictions between two published documents must be resolved within 30 days of detection. The resolution must be recorded in the decision log (GOV-001) and in the Commentary sections of both affected documents.

6. **R-META-004-06:** The cross-reference register must be updated whenever a new article is published or an existing article's cross-references change. The register is not a "nice to have." It is the institution's map of its own interconnections.

7. **R-META-004-07:** Known, accepted inconsistencies must be documented in the consistency exception register with a justification for why the inconsistency is acceptable. Unjustified inconsistencies are not permitted in published documentation.

8. **R-META-004-08:** When two domains disagree about the canonical terminology for a concept, the domain that is more foundational (closer to the root of the dependency graph) has authority. If neither domain is more foundational, the LRNG domain glossary is the tiebreaker.

## 6. Failure Modes

- **Audit fatigue.** The cross-domain audit is thorough but time-consuming. Over time, the operator performs it less rigorously, focusing on domains they care about and neglecting others. Inconsistencies accumulate in the neglected domains. Mitigation: the audit procedure is structured to be systematic rather than intuitive, reducing the operator's ability to unconsciously skip domains.

- **Glossary neglect.** The glossary is not updated as new terms are introduced. Over time, the glossary becomes incomplete and ceases to serve as the authoritative terminology source. Authors define their own terms ad hoc, and terminological consistency erodes. Mitigation: R-META-004-02 makes glossary inclusion a prerequisite for publication. The self-review checklist in META-00-ART-001 includes a terminology check.

- **Cascade avoidance.** When a revision creates the need for cascade updates across multiple domains, the operator avoids making the revision because the cascade work is overwhelming. The original inaccuracy persists because fixing it is too expensive. Mitigation: R-META-004-03 requires cascade updates but does not require them to be completed simultaneously. Revision tasks can be created and scheduled.

- **Exception creep.** The consistency exception register is used too liberally. Instead of resolving inconsistencies, the operator documents them as "acceptable" because resolution is difficult. Over time, the exception register becomes a catalog of unresolved problems. Mitigation: each exception must include a justification. The justification is reviewed during the annual audit. If the justification is weak, the exception is escalated to a consistency issue requiring resolution.

- **Reference rot.** Cross-references degrade over time as articles are revised, archived, or reorganized. The cross-reference register is not maintained. References in published documents point to sections that no longer exist or to documents that have been substantially revised. Mitigation: the reference integrity check in the annual audit catches reference rot systematically.

## 7. Recovery Procedures

1. **If terminological inconsistency is pervasive:** Conduct a full terminology audit across all domains. Rebuild the glossary from scratch if necessary. For each term, determine the canonical form, update the glossary, and create a revision task for every article that uses a non-canonical form. Prioritize by domain criticality: security and operations terminology first, then infrastructure, then everything else.

2. **If contradictions have accumulated between domains:** List every known contradiction. Prioritize by severity: safety-critical contradictions first, then procedural contradictions, then factual contradictions. Resolve the top five within 30 days. Schedule the remainder for resolution over the next quarter.

3. **If the cross-reference register does not exist or is severely outdated:** Rebuild it. This is a tedious but essential task. Read every published article and record every cross-domain reference. This is also an opportunity to detect broken references and inconsistencies.

4. **If the consistency exception register has been abused:** Review every entry. For each, re-evaluate the justification. Entries with weak justifications are reclassified as consistency issues requiring resolution. Set a deadline for resolution.

## 8. Evolution Path

- **Years 0-5:** The corpus is small enough that cross-domain consistency can be maintained through the operator's memory and attention. The formal tools (glossary, cross-reference register, consistency exception register) are being established. The annual audit is quick because there are relatively few articles.

- **Years 5-15:** The corpus has grown to the point where memory alone is insufficient. The formal tools become essential. The annual audit becomes more time-consuming but also more valuable. Patterns of inconsistency should be identified and structural solutions implemented (e.g., template language for commonly repeated specifications).

- **Years 15-30:** A successor may be contributing. The glossary and the consistency enforcement procedures become critical training tools for the new author. The audit process may need to be expanded to accommodate a larger corpus. Consider splitting the audit into semi-annual phases (reference integrity in one half, contradiction detection in the other).

- **Years 30-50+:** The consistency challenge is at its most complex. Decades of articles, multiple authors, evolving terminology, and changing systems create an environment where consistency enforcement is a permanent, ongoing discipline rather than a periodic event. The tools and procedures defined here should be refined based on decades of experience.

## 9. Commentary Section

**2026-02-16 -- Founding Entry:**
I am writing this article at a moment when the institution has five published articles. The idea of a cross-domain consistency audit across hundreds of articles is abstract. The tools I am defining here -- the glossary, the cross-reference register, the domain interface map -- are blueprints for structures that do not yet need to exist. I am writing them now because I know, from experience with other documentation systems, that consistency problems are exponentially harder to fix than to prevent. Every article published without a glossary entry makes the eventual glossary harder to write. Every cross-reference created without a register makes the eventual register harder to compile. The discipline must start now, when it is easy, so that it is habitual when it becomes necessary.

I also want to acknowledge that some inconsistency is inevitable and even healthy. When the SECR domain and the OPSYS domain describe the same system from different perspectives, minor differences in emphasis and framing are expected. Security documentation foregrounds threats and controls. Operations documentation foregrounds procedures and schedules. The same system, viewed through these two lenses, will look different. That is not inconsistency -- that is the value of having multiple domains. The inconsistencies this article targets are the harmful kind: contradictions, broken references, and terminological confusion. The productive kind -- different perspectives on shared subjects -- is what makes the multi-domain structure valuable.

## 1. Purpose

This article explains why the commentary system exists, how it works, and why it matters. Commentary is one of the most distinctive features of this institution's documentation architecture. Most documentation systems have one channel: the text of the document itself. This institution has two: the document body and the commentary. Understanding why both channels exist, what belongs in each, and how they interact is essential for anyone who writes or reads institutional documentation.

The commentary system serves three purposes that no other part of the documentation architecture serves. First, it preserves the human voice alongside the institutional voice. The document body speaks for the institution; commentary speaks for the person. Second, it creates a temporal record of changing understanding. The document body represents the current best knowledge; commentary represents the journey of understanding over time. Third, it provides a mechanism for institutional self-reflection that does not compromise the clarity and authority of the documents themselves. Commentary is the institution's conscience -- the place where doubts, lessons, corrections of perspective, and honest reflections live.

This article is addressed to every current and future contributor to the institution's documentation. It tells you what commentary is for, when to use it, how to write it, and why you should care about a system that might seem like an afterthought but is, in fact, one of the institution's most important long-term assets.

## 2. Scope

**In scope:**

- The philosophy behind the commentary system: why it exists and what values it serves.
- The design of the commentary system: how commentary is structured, stored, and displayed.
- The distinction between commentary and revision: when to add a comment versus when to revise the document body.
- Commentary as a tool for institutional memory and generational knowledge transfer.
- Commentary voice and style: how commentary differs from the document body in voice and register.
- The long-term value of commentary: how commentary accumulates meaning over decades.
- Commentary ethics: honesty, permanence, and the prohibition on retroactive editing.

**Out of scope:**

- The technical formatting of commentary entries (covered in META-00-ART-001, Section 6).
- The documentation lifecycle in general (covered in META-003).
- Cross-domain consistency in commentary (commentary is exempt from most consistency requirements because it is reflective, not prescriptive).
- The annual documentation census procedures for evaluating commentary (covered in META-001).

## 3. Background

The commentary system was designed to solve a problem that traditional documentation ignores: the problem of institutional memory.

Traditional documentation captures what is true now. When the truth changes, the documentation is revised to reflect the new truth. The old truth disappears. The chain of reasoning that led from the old truth to the new truth is lost. The failed experiments that informed the current approach are forgotten. The doubts that were overcome, the mistakes that were made, the context that made certain decisions feel urgent -- all of it vanishes with each revision.

This loss is acceptable for a document that will be read and discarded. It is catastrophic for a document that is part of a fifty-year institution. Consider: in 2040, a successor will encounter a system configuration that seems suboptimal. Without commentary, they have two options: change it (risking the destruction of a configuration that was chosen for reasons they cannot see) or leave it (perpetuating a genuinely suboptimal configuration out of fear of breaking something). With commentary, they have a third option: read the commentary, understand why the configuration was chosen, evaluate whether those reasons still apply, and make an informed decision.

Commentary is the institution's memory of itself. Not memory of what is true (that is what the document body provides) but memory of how the institution came to know what it knows. Memory of the journey, not just the destination.

This concept draws from several traditions. Academic journals publish original articles and subsequent commentary, allowing the field's understanding to evolve publicly. Legal systems publish judicial opinions and subsequent annotations, building a body of interpretive knowledge around the letter of the law. Religious traditions maintain primary texts with centuries of commentary that provide context, interpretation, and application across different eras and cultures. In each case, the commentary does not replace the primary text. It enriches it. It creates a conversation across time.

The holm.chat commentary system adapts this tradition for a self-sovereign documentation institution. The "conversation" is between the institution's past, present, and future operators. The commentary record is the mechanism by which they communicate across years and decades, sharing not just information but wisdom -- the hard-won, context-dependent, often personal understanding that cannot be captured in a procedure or a specification.

## 4. System Model

### 4.1 The Two-Channel Architecture

Every article in the institution has two channels of content:

**Channel 1: The Document Body.** This is the authoritative text. It contains the Purpose, Scope, Background, System Model, Rules & Constraints, Failure Modes, Recovery Procedures, Evolution Path, and References. The document body represents the institution's current, official position on the topic. It is written in the institutional voice (per META-002). It is revised when the truth changes. It goes through the full review and publication cycle.

**Channel 2: The Commentary.** This is the reflective record. It contains dated entries by operators past and present. Commentary represents individual perspectives, reflections, experiences, and observations. It is written in the Reflective register (per META-002, Section 4.1). It is never revised -- only appended to. It does not go through the review cycle. It is added by any operator at any time.

The two channels serve different functions and operate under different rules:

The document body is a map. Commentary is a journal of the journey that produced the map.

The document body is prescriptive. Commentary is reflective.

The document body is revised to remain current. Commentary is preserved to remain historical.

The document body speaks with institutional authority. Commentary speaks with personal honesty.

A reader who reads only the document body will know what to do. A reader who also reads the commentary will understand why.

### 4.2 When to Comment vs. When to Revise

The distinction between commentary and revision is the most important operational concept in the commentary system. Getting it wrong undermines both channels: commentary that should have been a revision leaves the document body inaccurate, while revision that should have been commentary erases institutional memory.

META-00-ART-001, Section 6.1 provides the foundational rule: "Commentary is additive and reflective. Revision is corrective and structural. If a reader would be misled by reading the article without the commentary, the article needs a revision, not a comment."

This article elaborates with a decision framework:

**Use commentary when:**

- You have a new observation, but the document body is still correct. ("I ran the backup procedure described in Section 7.1 today and found that it takes 20 minutes longer than estimated. The procedure itself is correct, but the time estimate should be updated in the next revision.")

- You want to preserve the reasoning behind a decision. ("We chose ZFS over Btrfs for reasons documented in the Background section. I want to add that a secondary factor was the availability of experienced ZFS administrators in the broader community, which matters for the knowledge acquisition path defined in the LRNG domain.")

- You want to flag something for future attention without triggering an immediate revision. ("The vendor of our charge controllers has been acquired. The product line will likely be discontinued within 5 years. This does not affect the current documentation, but successor equipment should be evaluated starting in 2028.")

- You want to record a lesson learned from operating the system the document describes. ("During the storm on 2027-03-15, the backup power system performed exactly as documented. The one surprise was that the transition time was 3.2 seconds rather than the documented 2 seconds. This is within acceptable tolerances but worth monitoring.")

- You want to express doubt, uncertainty, or a changed perspective. ("When I wrote this article, I was confident that RAID 6 was the right choice for our primary storage array. After two years of operation, I am less certain. The rebuild times after a disk failure are longer than I expected. I have not changed the recommendation yet, but a future operator should evaluate RAID Z3 or distributed storage approaches.")

**Use revision when:**

- The document body is factually wrong. A specification has changed. A procedure has been updated. A system has been replaced.

- The document body is dangerously incomplete. A critical failure mode is not documented. A safety warning is missing. A recovery procedure is inadequate.

- A reader following the document body as written would take incorrect action. The document is not merely imprecise -- it is misleading.

- The document's scope needs to change. It covers too much, too little, or the wrong things.

### 4.3 Commentary as Generational Bridge

The most important function of commentary may be the one that is hardest to appreciate in the present: its role as a bridge between generations of operators.

When the founding operator writes a document, the reasoning behind the document is obvious to them. They lived through the decisions. They remember the alternatives that were considered and rejected. They know the context in which the choices were made. None of this needs to be in the document body because the operator carrying it in their head.

But the operator who reads that document in 2045 does not have access to any of that context. They see only the decisions, not the reasoning. They see only the conclusions, not the deliberation. Without commentary, they must either trust the decisions blindly (fragile) or re-derive the reasoning from scratch (wasteful and error-prone).

Commentary closes this gap. When the founding operator writes a commentary entry explaining why a particular approach was chosen, what alternatives were considered, what doubts existed, and what experiences confirmed or challenged the decision, they are creating a bridge across time. The 2045 reader can walk across that bridge, understanding not just what was decided but why, and can then make informed judgments about whether the original reasoning still applies.

This bridging function compounds over time. The founding operator's commentary bridges 2026 to 2035. A successor's commentary bridges 2035 to 2045. A third operator's commentary bridges 2045 to 2055. The commentary section of a long-lived document becomes a timeline of institutional understanding, each entry a waypoint in the institution's evolving relationship with its own knowledge.

### 4.4 Commentary Ethics

Commentary operates under a specific ethical framework derived from ETH-001:

**Honesty is mandatory.** Commentary is the place for honest reflection, including doubt, error, and changed minds. A commentary entry that conceals a mistake or overstates confidence is worse than no entry at all. If you were wrong, say you were wrong. If you are unsure, say you are unsure. The value of commentary lies entirely in its trustworthiness.

**Permanence is a feature.** Commentary is append-only. Entries are never edited after the day they are written. Entries are never deleted. If a commentary entry is factually incorrect, a subsequent entry corrects it by reference. This permanence is not a limitation -- it is the mechanism by which commentary preserves the institution's history. An edited commentary is a rewritten history, and rewritten history is no history at all.

**Attribution is required.** Every commentary entry must identify its author and its date. In a single-operator institution, the author may seem obvious. It is documented anyway, for three reasons: succession may bring new authors, the date is as important as the author, and the habit of attribution supports the habit of accountability.

**Proportionality is expected.** Commentary should be proportional to the insight it contains. A one-sentence observation deserves one sentence of commentary. A fundamental shift in understanding deserves several paragraphs. Commentary that is routinely long and discursive trains readers to skim it, which defeats its purpose. Commentary that is routinely terse fails to capture the context that makes it valuable.

### 4.5 Commentary-Driven Revision Triggers

Commentary sometimes reaches a point where it signals that the document body needs revision. META-00-ART-001, Section 6.5 defines four triggers. This article elaborates on the underlying principle:

When the commentary is doing the document body's job, the document body needs revision.

If a reader must read the commentary to correctly understand the document, the document is deficient. The document body must be self-sufficient. Commentary enriches understanding; it must not be required for understanding. When commentary has accumulated to the point where it is functionally a supplement to the document body -- when the "real" truth lives in the commentary rather than in the document -- a revision is overdue.

The practical test: read the document body without the commentary. If you would act differently after reading the commentary, the document body needs to be revised to incorporate whatever the commentary revealed.

## 5. Rules & Constraints

1. **R-META-005-01:** Commentary is append-only. No commentary entry may be edited after the day it is written. No commentary entry may be deleted. Corrections to previous commentary are made through new commentary entries that reference the earlier entry by date.

2. **R-META-005-02:** Every commentary entry must include the date and the author's identifier. The date format is YYYY-MM-DD per META-00-ART-001.

3. **R-META-005-03:** Commentary entries are chronological. New entries are always appended after existing entries, never inserted between them.

4. **R-META-005-04:** Adding commentary does not change the article's version number. Commentary is metadata, not content. It does update the `last_modified` date in the front-matter.

5. **R-META-005-05:** Commentary must not contain operational instructions, rules, or specifications that are not present in the document body. If the commentary introduces new procedural guidance, that guidance must be incorporated into the document body through a formal revision.

6. **R-META-005-06:** Commentary is exempt from the formal review workflow. An operator may add commentary at any time without triggering a review cycle. This exemption exists because commentary must be low-friction to be used. If adding a commentary entry required a full review, commentary would not be written.

7. **R-META-005-07:** When three or more commentary entries on the same article address the same issue, a revision of the document body is triggered. The operator must evaluate whether the document body should be updated to reflect the accumulated commentary. This evaluation must be recorded, even if the decision is to defer revision.

8. **R-META-005-08:** When an article is revised, all existing commentary is preserved in the new version. Commentary that is no longer relevant (because the revision addressed the issue the commentary raised) is not removed. It remains as historical context.

9. **R-META-005-09:** Commentary must be written in the Reflective register as defined in META-002. The first person singular is permitted and encouraged. The voice should be personal, honest, and human.

10. **R-META-005-10:** Commentary from the founding operator and commentary from successors carry equal authority. No commentary entry is more "official" than another by virtue of its author. The value of commentary is in its content and its honesty, not in the status of its author.

## 6. Failure Modes

- **Commentary drought.** The operator stops writing commentary. Documents accumulate without reflective context. The institution's memory of its own reasoning begins to fade. Mitigation: the annual operations cycle includes a prompt to review each root document and add commentary if warranted. Commentary should be a habit, not a chore.

- **Commentary flood.** The operator writes excessive commentary, turning every observation into a long entry. Readers learn to skip the commentary section because it is disproportionately long relative to its insight content. Mitigation: the proportionality ethic in Section 4.4. Not every thought warrants a commentary entry. Commentary should be meaningful, not voluminous.

- **Commentary as avoidance.** The operator uses commentary to note problems with the document body instead of revising the document body. "This procedure is probably wrong" lives in the commentary for years while the procedure remains unchanged. Mitigation: R-META-005-07 creates a trigger for revision when commentary repeatedly addresses the same issue. The practical test in Section 4.5 catches cases where commentary is doing the document body's job.

- **Commentary without context.** Entries are too terse to be useful. "Tested. Works." provides no future value. What was tested? Under what conditions? What observations were made? Mitigation: the proportionality ethic works in both directions. While commentary should not be excessively long, it should be long enough to convey context. The standard is: would a reader in 2045 be able to understand and benefit from this entry?

- **Retroactive editing.** An operator edits or deletes an old commentary entry, destroying the historical record. This may be motivated by embarrassment (an old entry was wrong) or by a desire for tidiness (old entries seem irrelevant). Mitigation: R-META-005-01 is absolute. Commentary is append-only. The permanence is the value. An entry that was wrong is valuable precisely because it shows how understanding evolved.

- **Founder worship or dismissal.** A successor treats the founding operator's commentary as sacred (never questioning it) or as irrelevant (ignoring it because "things have changed"). Mitigation: R-META-005-10 establishes that all commentary carries equal authority. The founding operator's commentary is valuable for its historical context, but it is not more authoritative than a successor's direct experience with the systems as they exist now.

## 7. Recovery Procedures

1. **If commentary has not been written for an extended period:** Do not try to retroactively write commentary for the intervening period. That would be speculation, not reflection. Instead, write a single commentary entry acknowledging the gap: "No commentary was added between [date] and [date]. The reasons were [honest explanation]. Key events during this period that warrant retrospective documentation include [list]." Then resume regular commentary going forward.

2. **If commentary has been retroactively edited or deleted:** This is a violation of R-META-005-01. If the original text can be recovered from backups, restore it. If it cannot, add a commentary entry documenting the violation: "A previous commentary entry dated [date] was edited/deleted on [date]. The original content is [reconstructed as best as possible / not recoverable]. This violation of the append-only rule is acknowledged and the circumstances documented here."

3. **If commentary has been used as a substitute for revision:** Identify the documents where commentary is doing the document body's job (per the practical test in Section 4.5). Create revision tasks for each. When the revision is complete, add a commentary entry noting: "Revision [version] incorporates insights from commentary dated [dates]."

4. **If commentary quality has degraded:** Re-read this article, particularly the ethics section (4.4) and the generational bridge section (4.3). Then re-read the commentary entries in the five founding articles (ETH-001 through OPS-001) as examples of the intended quality and voice. Use those entries as calibration points for future commentary.

## 8. Evolution Path

- **Years 0-5:** Commentary is sparse because the institution is new. There is little to reflect on. The founding operator is building systems and writing documentation simultaneously; commentary will be brief and focused on "why I chose this" and "what I was uncertain about." This is appropriate. Volume is not the goal. Honesty is the goal.

- **Years 5-15:** Commentary begins to accumulate meaningfully. Entries reflect operational experience, lessons learned, and evolving understanding. Some commentary-driven revisions will occur. The commentary sections of long-standing articles begin to show the arc of the institution's learning curve. This is the period where the value of commentary becomes concretely visible.

- **Years 15-30:** Commentary becomes the primary bridge between the founding operator and successors. The founding operator's commentary is now historical -- a record of what the institution's creator was thinking and why. A successor's commentary adds a second voice, a second perspective, and often a productive tension with the founding perspective. The commentary section becomes a conversation across time.

- **Years 30-50+:** The commentary record spans decades. Articles with rich commentary histories become the institution's most valuable knowledge assets -- not because the commentary is always right, but because the commentary documents the institution's evolving understanding of itself. New operators do not just inherit a documentation system. They inherit a record of thought, reflection, and institutional self-awareness that no specification or procedure could ever capture.

## 9. Commentary Section

**2026-02-16 -- Founding Entry:**
There is something paradoxical about writing the first commentary entry for an article about the commentary system. This is the snake eating its tail. But the paradox is instructive: the commentary system is self-referential by design. It is the institution's capacity for self-reflection made concrete.

I designed the commentary system because I have read too many technical documents that are technically correct and completely opaque. They tell you what to do but not why. They describe the current state but not how the institution got there. When you encounter a decision you do not understand, you have no recourse. The documentation is silent about its own reasoning. I have made frustrating decisions in past roles because the reasoning behind existing configurations was lost to time. I rebuilt things that were intentionally built the way they were. I "fixed" things that were working as designed but appeared wrong because I lacked context.

Commentary is my attempt to ensure that no future operator of this institution has that experience. When they encounter a decision they do not understand, there should be a commentary entry that explains the thinking. When they want to change something, there should be a commentary entry that documents why it was done this way, so they can evaluate whether those reasons still apply. And when they inevitably disagree with me -- which they should, because they will know things I do not -- the commentary system gives them a place to document their disagreement and their alternative perspective without destroying mine.

The append-only rule is the heart of the system. I will be tempted to edit old entries. Every writer is. I will write something that seems brilliant today and embarrassing next year. The temptation to revise it will be real. But the value of commentary lies in its honesty, including the honesty of having been wrong. An institution that can only show its best thinking is an institution that is lying about its past. This institution does not do that. That is what the commentary system is for.
